                <h1>My Past</h1>
                <p> I was born in Lewiston, Idaho. I spent the first five years of my life living with my
                    grandparents in China, and then moved back to the United States to start kindergarden. While other
                    kids were
                    exploring nature and catching bugs at that age, I was running around my family's resturant, messing
                    around,
                    under my parent's watchful eyes. Up until college, that restaurant was the only thing I knew. I was
                    practically
                    running that entire front of house in high school. Unfortunately, due to Covid and staffing, it
                    closed down
                    once I left for college.</p>

                <h1>My Present</h1>
                <p>Currently, I am studying at the University of Idaho, majoring in Computer Science. I am also
                    President of the
                    Vandal Table Tennis Club. I first joined the club back in my freshman year, and I had never played
                    before coming
                    to the University. Over the years, I worked my way up and now I would say I'm pretty decent at the
                    sport. Another
                    hobby of mine is collecting Pokemon cards. I started this with my girlfriend, and it's been fun
                    getting rare cards.
                    We have a neat little collection that's worth a bit of money.</p>
