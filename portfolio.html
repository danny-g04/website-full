                <h2>String and integer calculator </h2>
                <p> I built this project as part of my Cybersecurity coding class. It's a calculator with 2 main
                    functions. The first is as a normal calculator, being able to add, subtract, multiple, divide, and
                    mod numbers. The second function is to do these operations on a string. Depending on the operator
                    you give the calculator, it will modify the string such as repeating it a certain number of times or
                    deleting characters from it. Since this project was built in a cybersecurity class, it does type
                    validation and error checking of user input very throughly. </p>

                <h2>Mouse Cancer Detection </h2>
                <p> Using Processing, I created a program that looked at sheets of mice brain to determine if there was
                    cancer present. The program created a layer of pixels on top of the original image and then looked
                    at the pixel's color. If the pixel was darker than a certain threshold I had set, it was turn that
                    pixel a certain color. It did this for every pixel in the image and counted up how many pixels got
                    colored. If the number of colored pixels were above a certain amount, there was a very high
                    likelyhood that the mice had cancer in it's brain.</p>
